# C - Binary trees

## structures
### Basic Binary Tree
```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */

struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

### Binary Search Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```

### AVL Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```

### Max Binary Heap
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
**Note:** For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they donâ€™t follow any kind of rule.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:
* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by Holberton
School.

## Helper File :raised_hands:
* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c): C function that prints binary
trees in a pretty way.
